- Adjusted Trakt token refresh to 24 hours.
- Added "Personal Lists" to My Lists. Here you can make personal lists that can be used on this instance of Fen Light. Movies or TV Shows supported.
- Added Settings->Content->Context Menu->"Context Menu Order" to change the order of Context Menu items for media displayed by Fen Light. Idea from Kodifitzwell.
- Added more flexibility for using external sources modules.
- Large refactoring of code using ideas from Fen & Fen Light forks. Thanks to those pushing forward.
