[COLOR darkgoldenrod]Thanks for the nice Easynews playback workaround find [B]Kodifitzwell[/B].[/COLOR]
- Added Settings->Playback->Playback Utilities->"Easynews Playback Method". Use this to set a playback method to resolve Easynews links...
NONE: No special method used.
RETRY: Retries the EN link if it fails the first time (slow and doesn't work on some hardware).
NO SEEK: Tells Kodi the file is not seekable, which makes EN happy. The file will usually play first try and quickly, but you will not be able to seek forward/backward outside of the current cached data.
BOTH: Will use NO SEEK, and will also allow for RETRY. Probably not needed for most setups. But this covers all.
