[COLOR red][B]Version 2.1.45[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "TV Show & Anime" to Search menu. Here you can search and include all series, both regular and anime. Uses `tmdb_tv_search` action, so skin intergration should be fixed for skins that support custom search queries.
- Added "Include anime in tv show watched progress" to Content->General. Enable this and your anime watched progress will also appear in the regular tv show progress menus.
- Added External Scrapers filter to settings. On by default.
- Re-fixed art from TMDb.
- Other changes/fixes.
