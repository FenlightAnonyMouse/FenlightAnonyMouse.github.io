[COLOR red][B]Version 2.1.10[B][COLOR]
- [REQUEST] Added ability for Fen Light to remember your reuselanguageinvoker state when updating.
- [REQUEST] Added RPDb (Rating Posters) support. Enter your API in Settings-Accounts, then clear the meta cache. Apologies to Fitzwell. I wasn't going to add this but it was requested and was too easy in the end with no API call needed.
